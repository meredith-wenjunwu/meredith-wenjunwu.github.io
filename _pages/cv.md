# Research Experience

- [<span style="color:blue">UW Graphics and Imaging Laboratory</span>](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/)  <br/>Advisor: Linda Shapiro*
  - Detecting cellular-level entities (e.g. [<span style="color:blue">Nuclei</span>](/files/nuclei-detection.pdf), [<span style="color:blue">melanocytes</span>](/files/Melanocyte.pdf) and etc.) and structural entities (e.g. mid-level features like melanocyte bridges, etc.) in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 
  - Developing an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes.
- [<span style="color:blue">The Bio-Medical Informatics and Bio-Imaging Laboratory</span>](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech <br/>Advisor: May Wang*
  - Extracted 3D image features from processed PET images; applied weighted and unweighted voting ensembles of baseline classifiers to classify PET images into categories that correspond to diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. **The paper was accepted to *EMBC 2017*.**
- [<span style="color:blue">The Cardiovascular Fluid Mechanics Lab (CFM Lab)</span>](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech <br/>Advisor: Zhenglun Wei and Ajit Yoganathan*
  - Performed computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS Fluent *(ANSYS, PA)* on pre-surgery and post-surgery patient under both time-averaged and pulsatile boundary conditions; evaluated flow efficiency using simplified power loss or a viscous dissipation rate metric. **The paper was accepted to *Annals of Biomedical Engineering*.**

# Previous Projects

- **AirTech - iOS application for lung function monitoring**                    \[ Jan 2017 - May 2017\]<br/> Developed a lung function monitoring device for chronic lung disease patients that quantifies air flow rate and exhaled gas components, conducts test validity check, and automatically records test results to compatible iOS application.<br/>\[ [<span style="color:blue">Code</span>](https://github.com/meredith-wenjunwu/AirTech-Final) \]                    \[[<span style="color:blue">Demo</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy7s0ZQS1aQ)\]
- **Cancer Stage Diagnosis using Biomedical Image processing**            \[ Jan 2016 - May 2016\]<br/>Developed supervised and unsupervised segmentation of cellular structures using classification algorithms; extracted various types of features and adopted multiple dimensionality reduction methods; used extracted features to build various classifiers for diagnosing cancer stage from breast biopsy histological images and achieved F1 score of about 0.9. <br/> \[[<span style="color:blue">Demo</span>](https://youtu.be/m85OWh-0uZM)\]
- **Robotics**                                                                                                             \[ Jan 2016 - May 2016\]<br/> Programmed a scribbler robot to perform task in image processing (exploration of surrounding areas using image stitching) and in navigation (obstacle identification, path planning and robot localization).
- **PTT Advisor+**                                                                                                      \[May 2016- Sept 2016\]<br/> Collaborated with CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and administered the implementation and design of iOS mobile app to provide guidance for physicians to prescribe anticoagulant drug and test. <br/> \[[<span style="color:blue">App Store link</span>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ptt-advisor/id537989131?mt=8)\]
