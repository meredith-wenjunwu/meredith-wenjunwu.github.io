# Research Experience

- [UW Graphics and Imaging Laboratory](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/)

  *Advisor: Linda Shapiro*

  - Detecting cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions.

- [The Cardiovascular Fluid Mechanics Lab (CFM Lab)](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech

  *Advisor: May Wang*

  - Extracted 3D image features, such as voxel intensities, volume and textures, from processed PET images; applied weighted and unweighted voting ensembles of baseline classifiers, such as support vector machine and random forest, to classify PET images into categories that correspond to diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. **The paper was accepted to *EMBC 2017*.**

- [The Bio-Medical Informatics and Bio-Imaging Laboratory (Bio-MIB Lab)](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech

  *Advisor: Zhenglun Wei and Ajit Yoganathan*

  - Performed computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS Fluent (ANSYS, PA) on pre-surgery and post-surgery patient under both time-averaged and pulsatile boundary conditions; evaluated flow efficiency using simplified power loss or a viscous dissipation rate metric. **The paper was accepted to *Annals of Biomedical Engineering*.**
