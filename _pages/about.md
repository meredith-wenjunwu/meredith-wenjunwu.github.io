I am a first year Ph.D student in [Biomedical Informatics](http://bime.uw.edu/), advised by [Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/) at University of Washington (UW). 

Before coming to UW, I studied Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I worked as undergraduate research assisstant at [Bio-MIB Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/) and [CFM Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/).

## Research Interest

My research interests are medical image analysis and computing. 

Currently, I am working on [ISIC data challenge](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/task3/) and diagnosis of melanocytic lesions using whole-slide skin biopsy images.
