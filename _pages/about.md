I am a second year Ph.D student in [Biomedical Informatics](http://bime.uw.edu/), advised by [Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/) at University of Washington (UW). 

Before coming to UW, I studied Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I worked as undergraduate research assisstant at [Bio-MIB Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/) and [CFM Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/). 

I can be reached at [wenjunw [at] cs.washington.edu](mailto: wenjunw@uw.edu). 



## Research Interest \[[<span style="color:blue">CV</span>](/files/CV.pdf)\]

My research interests lie at the intersection of **biomedical image analysis, machine learning, and computer vision**, especially in designing **interpretable tools and architectures** that have potential in real-world clinical applications. 

I'm currently working on an attention-based multi-task architecture for whole-slide skin biopsy diagnosis and segmentation.
