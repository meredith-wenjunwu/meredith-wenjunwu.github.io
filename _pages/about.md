I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta, with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Washington. I had the privilege of being mentored by the esteemed [Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/) during my doctoral studies at [UW's Biomedical Informatics program](http://bime.uw.edu/).

Before coming to UW, I studied Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I worked as undergraduate research assisstant at [Bio-MIB Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/) and [CFM Lab](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/).
